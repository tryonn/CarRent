    When the end of the project is near, the project manager organizes a meeting with the project team and the stakeholders
    to confirm that the project fulfilled the project goals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    If some of the project goals have not been satisfied, stakeholders could decide to accept the product conditionally
    upon certain corrective actions being taken. In this situation, the project manager would need to plan how to resolve
    the remaining issues. If the goals that were not fulfilled are critical for the stakeholders, they could decide to
    postpone the project acceptance until the issues are resolved.
