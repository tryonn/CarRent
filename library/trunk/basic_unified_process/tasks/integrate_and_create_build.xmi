    It is recommended that you integrate the implemented classes (see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;
    href=&quot;resources/implementation,_0YoQcMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0YoQcMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;&gt;Work Product:
    Implementation&lt;/a&gt;) incrementally bottom-up in the compilation-dependency hierarchy. At each increment you add one, or
    a few elements to the system.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    If two or more developers are working in parallel on the same component, their work is integrated through
    a&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;component integration workspace&lt;/b&gt;, into which the&amp;nbsp;developers deliver elements from their private
    development workspaces, and from which&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;
    href=&quot;resources/build,_0YuXEMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0YuXEMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;&gt;Work Product: Build&lt;/a&gt;(s)&amp;nbsp;can
    be constructed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    If a team of several individuals works in parallel on the same component, it is important that the team members share
    their results frequently, not waiting until late in the process to integrate the team's work.

    As integration of implemented elements occur, it is important that tests are performed to validate that nothing got
    broken during integration.

    After the final increment, when the&amp;nbsp;components&amp;nbsp;are ready and the associated build has been integration
    tested, the components&amp;nbsp;are delivered into the system integration workspace (see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p&gt;
    Several builds may be created in particular iteration. For each individual build, this step is performed only when
    components have been delivered to satisfy the requirements of that build.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Depending on the complexity and number of&amp;nbsp;components to be integrated, it is often more efficient to produce the
    target build in a number of steps, adding more&amp;nbsp;components with each step, and producing a series of intermediate
    'mini' builds - thus, each build planned for an iteration may, in turn, have its own sequence of transient intermediate
    builds. These are subjected to a minimal integration test&amp;nbsp;to ensure that what is added is compatible with what
    already exists in the system integration workspace. It should be easier to isolate and diagnose problems using this
    approach.&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Delivered&amp;nbsp;components are accepted&amp;nbsp;incrementally into the system integration workspace,&amp;nbsp;having any merge
    conflicts being resolved.&amp;nbsp;It is recommended that this&amp;nbsp;is done in a bottom-up approach with respect to the
    layered structure, making sure that the versions of the&amp;nbsp;components are consistent, taking imports into
    consideration. The increment of&amp;nbsp;components is compiled and linked into an intermediate build, which is then
    provided to the tester to execute a minimal system integration test.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;img height=&quot;172&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram described in accompanying text.&quot; src=&quot;resources/ac_intsy.gif&quot; width=&quot;501&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;picturetext&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
    This diagram shows a build produced in three increments. Some&amp;nbsp;components are only needed as stubs, to make it
    possible to compile and link the other components, and provide the essential minimal run-time behavior.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
    The final increment of a sequence produces the target build. When this has been minimally tested, an initial or
    provisional baseline is created for this build. The build is now made available to the tester for complete system
    testing. The nature and depth of this testing will be as planned for a particular iteration (as defined in &lt;a
    class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;
