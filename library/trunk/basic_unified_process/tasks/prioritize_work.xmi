    Analyst and project manager work together on prioritization of scenarios that represent some significant, central
    functionality to customers. Architect gives support by identifying scenarios that have a substantial architecture
    coverage or stress a delicate point of architecture. The development of these high importance, architectural
    significant scenarios take place early in the project, when the candidate architecture for the system is proposed.
    Architectural risks and quality factors expressed as supplemental requirements (e.g., system performance, system
    availability, etc.) come into scene and may drive prioritization of scenarios.
