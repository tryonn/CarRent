    Creating an architectural&amp;nbsp;proof-of-concept is usually a way to mitigate risks related to the architecture you plan
    to use for your system. For this reason you should, before starting building it, define what is the scope and objective
    of this proof-of-concept. Are you building it because you are plan to use a new technology, or because you plan to use
    a new COTS as part of your overall architecture?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Clearly defining the rationale and objective of this proof-of-concept will help you define which approach you should
    take on building it, and will help you assess&amp;nbsp;its success.

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p&gt;
    The&amp;nbsp;proof-of-concept can have different forms, ranging from a conceptual diagram to an executable prototype. Its
    form and the approach you will be using to construct it are directly related to the objectives you defined for the
    proof-of-concept.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    If the objective is to validate the integration with an external system you can develop a prototype to validate this
    integration on a meaningful transaction. If the objective is to validate the feasibility, perhaps searching
    documentation on previous successfull projects who used this approach would be enough.

    <sectionDescription>Using the chosen construction approach, you can then construct your proof-of-concept. You should also assess at the end
that it met the objectives you defined initially.</sectionDescription>
