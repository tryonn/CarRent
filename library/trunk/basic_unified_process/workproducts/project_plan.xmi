  <purpose>&lt;p&gt;
    The purpose of the Project Plan is to provide a central document where the any project team member can find the
    information on how the project will be managed.&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;</purpose>
  <representationOptions>The Project Plan usually defines also which specific process will be followed by the project, such as how the
requirementswill be managed, how the artifacts will be managed under configuration management, etc. This can be done
directly as a paragraph into the Project Plan, or in case such practices are standardized at the company level, it can be
done by referencing the company corresponding plan.</representationOptions>
