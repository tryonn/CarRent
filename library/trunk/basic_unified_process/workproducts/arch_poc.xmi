  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p&gt;
    The decision about whether or not&amp;nbsp;this artifact&amp;nbsp;is required and what form it should take depends on:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        how well the domain is understood - if the domain is unfamiliar,&amp;nbsp;having an architetural
        proof-of-concept&amp;nbsp;may not only help to explore possible solutions, but may also help the customer and
        development organizations to understand and clarify requirements
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        the novelty of the system - if the development organization has constructed many&amp;nbsp;similar systems previously
        then it should not be necessary to build a proof-of-concept - it should be possible to base a determination of
        feasibility on existing reference architectures and technologies
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        when any of the requirements are judged to be particularly onerous, even though the domain is familiar and the
        system is precedented; for example, when ultra-high transaction rates or extreme reliability are required
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</keyConsiderations>
  <purpose>&lt;p&gt;
    To demonstrate the feasibility of the project using the selected candidate architecture or to mitigate one or more
    architecturally significant risk(s).
&lt;/p&gt;</purpose>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>The Architectural Proof-of-Concept may be omitted when the problem domain is well-understood, the requirements are
well-defined, the system is well-precedented, and its development is evaluated as having low risk</reasonsForNotNeeding>
  <representationOptions>&lt;p&gt;
    This artifact may take many forms, for example:&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        a list of known technologies (frameworks, patterns, executable architectures) which seem appropriate to the
        solution
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        a sketch of a conceptual model of a solution using a notation such as UML
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        a simulation of a solution
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        an executable prototype
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</representationOptions>
