  <assignmentApproaches>&lt;p&gt;
    On agile&amp;nbsp;and small projects, the project manager role is usually played by a&amp;nbsp;single person.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    It is generally a good practice for the project manager to avoid taking on development responsibilities, like the
    architect responsibilities, in order to ensure that time pressure on management responsibilities doesn't cause
    development tasks to suffer, and vice versa.
