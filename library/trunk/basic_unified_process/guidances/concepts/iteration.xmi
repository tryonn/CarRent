    What is an Iteration?
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    An iteration encompasses the development activities that lead to a product &lt;b&gt;release&lt;/b&gt;â€”a stable, executable version
    of the product, together with any other peripheral elements necessary to use this release. So a development iteration
    is, in some sense, one complete pass through all the disciplines: Requirements, Analysis &amp;amp; Design, Implementation,
    and Test, at least. It is like a small waterfall project in itself. Note that evaluation criteria are established when
    each iteration is planned. The release will have planned capability which is demonstrable. The duration of an iteration
    will vary depending on the size and nature of the project, but it is likely that &lt;b&gt;multiple&lt;/b&gt; &lt;u&gt;builds&lt;/u&gt; will be
    constructed in &lt;b&gt;each&lt;/b&gt; iteration. This is a consequence of the continuous integration approach recommended as a
    best practice: as unit-tested components become available, they are integrated, then a build is produced and subjected
    to integration testing. In this way, the capability of the integrated software grows as the iteration proceeds, towards
    the goals set when the iteration was planned.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Iterations and releases allow a better usage over time of the various specialties in the team: developers, testers, and
    so forth. Regular releases let you break down the integration and test issues and spread them across the development
    cycle. These issues have often been the downfall of large projects because all problems were discovered at once during
    the single massive integration step, which occurred very late in the cycle, and where a single problem halts the whole
    team.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    At each iteration, artifacts are updated. It is said that this is a bit like &quot;growing&quot; software. Instead of developing
    artifacts one after another, in a pipeline fashion, they are evolving across the cycle, although at different rates.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Another characteristic of an iteration is to be timeboxed, mening the schedule for an iteration should be regarded as
    fixed, and the scope of the iteration's content actively managed to meet that schedule.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;picturetext&quot;&gt;
    Each iteration within a phase results in an executable release of the system.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Each phase in the RUP can be further broken down into iterations. An iteration is a complete development loop resulting
    in a release (internal or external) of an executable product, a subset of the final product under development, which
    grows incrementally from iteration to iteration to become the final system.
