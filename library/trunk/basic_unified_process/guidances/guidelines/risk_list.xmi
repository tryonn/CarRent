  <mainDescription>&lt;p&gt;
    A list of risks can be represented as a table containing risk attributes. As it is usual to rank risks by priority,
    spreadsheets may be an&amp;nbsp;alternative to capture risks. If for a given project there is a need to capture the risk
    list in an artifact, some of the existing ones can be used for that purpose, as described below.&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
    Recommended: risk list captured in the project plan
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    In this approach you put the overall risk list in the project plan. The iteration plan will contain only the tasks you
    will be doing during the iteration to mitigate the risks. This will ensure that the iteration plan contains only
    iteration information. The project plan has to be revisited constantly as you updated risks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
    Option: risk list captured in&amp;nbsp;the iteration plan
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    In this approach you enter the overall risk list in the current iteration plan. This approach ensures that you look at
    the risk list at each iteration, as it is part of your iteration plan. The only drawback is that your iteration plan
    will contain information that is not relevant to the current iteration. All the risks you have not&amp;nbsp;mitigated
    during the iteration&amp;nbsp;have to be&amp;nbsp;transfered to the next iteration plan.
