&lt;p&gt;
    Capabilities Patterns express and communicate process knowledge for a key area of interest such as a Discipline
    or&amp;nbsp;a practice and can be directly used by process practitioners to guide their work.&amp;nbsp; They are also used as
    building blocks to assemble &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot; href=&quot;./../../../base_concepts/guidances/concepts/delivery_process,_EhgqwO8MEdmKSqa_gSYthg.html&quot; guid=&quot;_EhgqwO8MEdmKSqa_gSYthg&quot;&gt;Delivery Processes&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;or larger Capability Patterns ensuring optimal reuse and
    application of the key practices they express.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Examples for Capability Pattern could be 'use case-based requirements management', 'use case analysis', or 'unit
    testing'. Typically but not necessarily, Capability Patterns have the scope of one Discipline providing a breakdown of
    reusable complex Activities, relationships to the Roles which perform Tasks within these Activities, as well as to the
    Work Products that are used and produced.&amp;nbsp; Generally, a Capability Pattern does not relate to any specific phase
    or iteration of a development lifecycle, and should not imply any.&amp;nbsp; In other words, a pattern should be designed
    in a way that it is applicable anywhere in a Delivery Process.&amp;nbsp; This enables its Activities to be flexibly
    assigned to whatever phases there are in the Delivery Process to which it is being applied.&amp;nbsp; An exception to this
    would be capability patterns that are intended to provide a template for quickly creating an iteration or portion of an
    iteration for a particular phase in a Delivery Process.&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
    Key applications&amp;nbsp;or areas of reuse for Capability Patterns are:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        To serve as building blocks for assembling Delivery Processes or larger Capability Patterns.&amp;nbsp; Normally
        developing a Delivery Process is not done from scratch but by systematically applying and binding patterns.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        To support direct execution in a development project that does not work following a well-defined process, but works
        based on loosely connected process fragments of practices in a flexible manner (for example, Agile Development).
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        To support process education by describing knowledge for a key area such as practices on how to perform the work
        for a Discipline (for example, Requirements Management), for a specific development technique (aspect-oriented
        development), or a specific technical area (for example, relational database design), which is used for education
        and teaching.&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The workflow of a Capability Pattern is usually represented using the UML Activity Diagram notation.&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;
