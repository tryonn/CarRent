  <mainDescription>&lt;p&gt;
    An instance of a Roadmap represents important documentation for the Activity or Process it is related to. Often a
    complex Activity such as a Process can be much easier understood by providing a walkthrough with a linear thread of a
    typical instantiation of this Activity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    In addition to making the process practitioner understand how work in the process is being performed, a Roadmap
    provides additional information about how Activities and Tasks relate to each other over time. Roadmaps are also used
    to show how specific aspects are distributed over a whole process providing a kind of filter on the Process for this
    information.
