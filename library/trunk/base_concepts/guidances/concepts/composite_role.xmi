  <mainDescription>&lt;p&gt;
    A Composite Role is a grouping of Roles that can be used in an Activity or Process to reduce the number of Roles. A
    Composite Role is thus for the Tasks and Work Products defined for the Roles it refers to. A typical use of this
    construct occurs within a Process designed for a small team in which multiple standard Roles from the Method Content
    are assigned to a single resource. By using a Composite Role the Process suggests a typical clustering of Roles to
    Resources.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    A simple example is a Composite Role named &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; that groups together the
    &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tester&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Roles. Now, every time one of the Roles
    Implementer or Tester would normally be used within the breakdown structure, Developer is used instead. Hence, if a
    Task Descriptor is added to the Process, that has Implementer or Tester as the primary performer, this Role would be
    automatically be substituted by&amp;nbsp;the Composite Role instance Developer that links back to either Tester or
    Implementer (or both if both were listed as the Task performers).
