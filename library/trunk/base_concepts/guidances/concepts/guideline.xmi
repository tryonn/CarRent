  <mainDescription>&lt;p&gt;
    A Guideline usually focuses on how to perform a particular Task or grouping of Tasks (for example, grouped together as
    activities) or provides additional detail, rules, and recommendations on Work Products and their properties. Guidelines
    can include details about a variety of topics including:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        Practices and different approaches for doing work,
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        How to handle particular kinds of Content Elements,
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        Information on different subtypes and variants of Content Elements and how they evolve throughout a lifecycle,
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        Discussions on skills the performing Roles should acquire,
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        Measurements of progress and maturity, etc.
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Work products typically have associated guidelines which present information on how to develop, evaluate and use the
    Work Products . Guidelines contain much of the substance of a method and provide assistance in a number of contexts:
    they help you decide what to do, they help doing it, they help assess the quality of the work, and they help understand
    how a particular Work Product relates to the rest of the process.
