    An example for a report would be a use case model survey, which is generated by extracting diagram information from a
    graphical model and textual information from documents and combines these two types of information into a report.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Unlike regular Work Products, reports are not subject to version control. However they may be baselined to provide a
    historic audit trail of the report over time. In some cases, the development tools enable the report to be reproduced
    at any time by rerunning the report against the Work product's History.
