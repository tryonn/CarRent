    &lt;a id=&quot;What is an iteration&quot; name=&quot;What is an iteration&quot;&gt;What is an Iteration?&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    An iteration encompasses the development activities that lead to a product &lt;b&gt;release&lt;/b&gt;-a stable, executable version
    of the product, together with any other peripheral elements necessary to use this release. So a development iteration
    is in some sense one complete pass through all the disciplines: Requirements, Analysis &amp;amp; Design, Implementation,
    and Test, at least. It is like a small waterfall project in itself. Note that evaluation criteria are established when
    each iteration is planned. The release will have planned capability which is demonstrable. The duration of an iteration
    will vary depending on the size and nature of the project, but it is likely that &lt;b&gt;multiple&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot; href=&quot;./../../../rup/workproducts/rup_build,{53728CD9-FA47-4B58-A443-E9F9DC196916}.html&quot; guid=&quot;{53728CD9-FA47-4B58-A443-E9F9DC196916}&quot;&gt;builds&lt;/a&gt; will be constructed in &lt;b&gt;each&lt;/b&gt; iteration, as specified in
    the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../../rup/workproducts/rup_integration_build_plan,{FA56B557-857D-4122-8E60-7A4A84418EB1}.html&quot; guid=&quot;{FA56B557-857D-4122-8E60-7A4A84418EB1}&quot;&gt;Integration Build Plan&lt;/a&gt; for the iteration. This is a consequence of
    the continuous integration approach recommended in the Rational Unified Process (RUP): as unit-tested components become
    available, they are integrated, then a build is produced and subjected to integration testing. In this way, the
    capability of the integrated software grows as the iteration proceeds, towards the goals set when the iteration was
    planned. It could be argued that each build itself represents a mini-iteration, the difference is in the planning
    required and the formality of the assessment performed. It may be appropriate and convenient in some projects to
    construct builds on a daily basis, but these would not represent iterations as the RUP defines them-except perhaps for
    a very small, single person project. Even for small multi-person projects (for example, involving five people building
    10,000 lines of code), it would be very difficult to achieve an iteration duration of less than a week. For an
    explanation of why, see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../../rup/guidances/guidelines/software_development_plan,1.6567134597638413E-305.html&quot; guid=&quot;1.6567134597638413E-305&quot;&gt;Guideline: Software Development Plan&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--EndFragment--&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Why iterate&quot; name=&quot;Why iterate&quot;&gt;Why Iterate?&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Traditionally, projects have been organized to go through each discipline in sequence, once and only once. This leads
    to the &lt;b&gt;waterfall&lt;/b&gt; lifecycle:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img height=&quot;86&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram show one iteration going from Business Modeling to Deployment&quot;     src=&quot;resources/waterfall.gif&quot; width=&quot;368&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    This often results in an integration 'pile-up' late in implementation when, for the first time, the product is built
    and testing begins. Problems which have remained hidden throughout Analysis, Design and Implementation come boiling to
    the surface, and the project grinds to a halt as a lengthy bug-fix cycle begins.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    A more flexible (and less risky) way to proceed is to go several times through the various development disciplines,
    building a better understanding of the requirements, engineering a robust architecture, ramping up the development
    organization, and eventually delivering a series of implementations that are gradually more complete. This is called an
    &lt;b&gt;iterative&lt;/b&gt; lifecycle. Each pass through the sequence of process disciplines is called an &lt;b&gt;iteration&lt;/b&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img height=&quot;211&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram shows 3 sucessive iterations, each one going from Business Modeling to Deployment.&quot;     src=&quot;resources/iterative.gif&quot; width=&quot;431&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Therefore, from a development perspective the software lifecycle is a succession of &lt;b&gt;iterations&lt;/b&gt;, through which
    the software develops incrementally. Each iteration concludes with the &lt;b&gt;release&lt;/b&gt; of an executable product. This
    product may be a subset of the complete vision, but useful from some engineering or user perspective. Each release is
    accompanied by supporting work products: release description, user documentation, plans, and so on, and updated models
    of the system.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The main consequence of this iterative approach is that the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot; href=&quot;./../../../base_concepts/guidances/concepts/work_product,4.804531471620803E-306.html&quot; guid=&quot;4.804531471620803E-306&quot;&gt;work products&lt;/a&gt;, described earlier, grow and mature over time, as shown in the
    following diagram.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

    Information set evolution over the development phases.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
    Minor milestone
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Each iteration is concluded by a minor milestone, where the result of the iteration is assessed relative to the
    objective success criteria of that particular iteration.
