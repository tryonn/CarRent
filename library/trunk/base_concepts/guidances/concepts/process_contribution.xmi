  <mainDescription>&lt;p&gt;
    A Process Contribution is a special Process that externally defines additions and changes to an existing Process
    without directly modifying the existing Process. It achieves this by describing these additions and changes in a
    separate Process structure. This structure's elements relate to the other Process's elements using &quot;Contributes&quot; and
    &quot;Replace&quot; specializations. Process Contributions are normally packaged with Method Plug-ins that extend existing Method
    Plug-in with new capabilities.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    A Process Contribution is a kind of &quot;process plug-in&quot; that plugs additional breakdown structures into an existing
    Process and therefore updates it afterwards with new or changed capabilities. For example, the J2EE Plug-in plugs into
    the technology independent main Plug-in. It may update the generic Delivery Processes defined in that Plug-in with J2EE
    specific Activities. A respective &quot;.NET Plug-in&quot; could define similar updates relevant for that technology platform. A
    process practitioner could then apply the chosen Plug-in, thereby generating a technology specific Process, but keeping
    maintenance of his/her Processes minimal, because technology specific parts are kept separate and will be applied on
    demand only.
