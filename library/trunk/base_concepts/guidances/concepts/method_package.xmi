  <mainDescription>&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;font face=&quot;Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;A Method Package package defines how the method elements can be physically
    organized in package hierarchies. It is an abstract class for packaging Method Elements. All Method Elements shall be
    located in exactly one of Method Packageâ€™s concrete specializations (e.g. Content Package). Method Package defines
    common properties for all of its specializations.&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;font face=&quot;Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;Elements are organized in Method Packages to structure large scale of method
    content and processes as well as to define a mechanism for reuse. Method Elements from one package can reuse element
    from other packages by defining a reusedPackages link.&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;font face=&quot;Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;For example, a work product defined in one package can be used as an input
    for Tasks defined in other packages. By reusing it from one common place (i.e. the package in which it has been
    defined) ensures that no redundant definitions of the same elements are required. Also maintenance of method content is
    greatly improved as changes can be performed in only one place.&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;font face=&quot;Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    Note, that other packages will introduce more specializations of Method Package, e.g. Process Package and Process
    Component&lt;/font&gt;.
