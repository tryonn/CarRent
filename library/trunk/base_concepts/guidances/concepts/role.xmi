&lt;p&gt;
    A Role is a Method Content element that defines a set of related skills, competencies, and responsibilities. Roles are
    used by Tasks to specify who performs them as well as define a set of Work Products they are responsible for.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;node&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
    Roles are typically realized by an individual, or a set of individuals, working together as a team. A project team
    member typically fulfills many different roles. Note that &lt;b&gt;Roles are not individuals nor are they necessarily
    equivalent to job titles;&lt;/b&gt; instead, they describe how individuals should behave in the project and the
    responsibilities of an individual. Individual members of the organization will wear different hats, or perform
    different Roles. The mapping from individual to Role is performed by the project manager when planning and staffing the
    project.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;node&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
    While most roles are realized by people within the organization, people outside of the development organization play an
    important role: for example, that of the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../../rup/roles/rup_stakeholder,{7A4262EA-AB5B-431E-BB4A-3822FBF7F239}.html&quot; guid=&quot;{7A4262EA-AB5B-431E-BB4A-3822FBF7F239}&quot;&gt;Stakeholder&lt;/a&gt; of the project or product being developed.
