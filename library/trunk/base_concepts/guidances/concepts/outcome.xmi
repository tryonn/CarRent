  <mainDescription>&lt;p&gt;
    An Outcome describes intangible Work Products that are a result or state, such as an installed server or optimized
    network.&amp;nbsp;As the occurrence of an Outcome is often informally documented (for example, through minutes or memos),
    Outcomes may also be used to describe Work Products that are not formally defined.&amp;nbsp;A key differentiator for
    Outcomes against Artifacts is that Outcomes are not candidates for harvesting as reusable assets.&amp;nbsp; Outcomes can
    not have associated templates or examples and are not possible to reuse as assets on other projects.
