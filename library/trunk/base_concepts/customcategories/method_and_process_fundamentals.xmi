    What is UMA?
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    UMA is a state-of-the-art architecture for the conceiving, specifying, and storing of method and process metadata
    (a.ka. content). Its defining feature and fundamental innovation is that it achieves clear separation between generic
    core method content and it its application in the specification of business processes.
&lt;/p&gt;

    Separation of Concerns
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;font face=&quot;Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;Key &lt;em&gt;separations of concerns&lt;/em&gt; in the design UMA&lt;em&gt;:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;font face=&quot;Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;•The separation of core method content versus the application of method
        content in processes&lt;br /&gt;
        •The definition of an optional extensibility mechanism in the method for large scale management of method and
        process repositories&lt;br /&gt;
        •Packaging and configuration of method content, processes, and plugins in method libraries&lt;br /&gt;
        •A separation of recommended method and guidance description fields&lt;br /&gt;
        •A separation of semantic elements from their notation in process diagrams&lt;/font&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
    &lt;font face=&quot;Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;Method Content versus Process&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;font face=&quot;Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;The Unified Method Architecture (UMA) separates reusable core method content
    from its application inprocesses.Methodcontent provides step-by-step explanations, describing how specific development
    goals are achievedindependent oftheplacement of these steps within a development lifecycle. Processes take these method
    elements and relatethemintosemi-ordered sequences that are customized to specific types of projects.&lt;br /&gt;
    For example, a software development project that develops an application from scratch performs development
    taskssuchas“Develop Vision” or “Use Case Design” similar to a project that extends an existing software system.
    However,thetwoprojects will perform the Tasks at different points in time with a different emphasis, i.e. they will
    perform thestepsofthese tasks at different point of time and perhaps apply individual variations and additions.&lt;br /&gt;
    In contrast to other method engineering approaches, UMA’s unique solution allows each process to
    referencecommonmethodguidance from a common method content pool, which then makes up the actual process guidance.
    Becauseofthesereferences, changes in the methods will automatically be reflected in all processes using it.
    However,UMAstillallows overwriting certain method related guidance within a process as well as
    definingindividualprocess-specificrelationships for each process element (such as work breakdown and new relations to
    work productsandroles).&lt;br /&gt;
    Figure 4 shows the difference between method content and process by representing them as twodifferentdimensions.Method
    content describing how development work is being performed is categorized bydisciplines.Each discipline iscomprised of
    tasks (not visible in Figure 4) that provide step-by-step descriptions ofhow specificdevelopment goals areachieved. For
    a process, tasks have been selected from the method content and placedintoworkflows ready forinstantiation by
    allocating resources to perform the work and having real work products as theinputsand outputs of thetasks. As a
    result, the workload graphs shown in Figure 4 can be computed showing work effortforeach disciplineover time (from left
    to right).&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;/font&gt;
