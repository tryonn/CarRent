    Most functionality is expressed in terms of what the interface does, rather than how it looks while it's doing it or
    the specific interaction methods used (although there could be exceptions to this rule). But it's pretty much a
    no-brainer that if you've built the wrong thing, it's going to fail with its intended audience. Ideally, you should
    have a decent understanding of user requirements and functionality before you begin the design of the interface. But if
    you've missed a requirement or gotten one wrong, a paper prototype can help you find it.
