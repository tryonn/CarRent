  <mainDescription>Some types of usability problems can be found simply by looking for them—the false top, cascading menu, and keyboard-mouse
issues are ones I can often predict just by looking at a screen. However, there's something of a Catch-22 here: To find a
problem by inspection in a paper prototype, you have to know to look for it &lt;a id=&quot;691&quot; name=&quot;691&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;IDX-282&quot; name=&quot;IDX-282&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;and that knowledge only comes from having seen examples of it in real interfaces and/or interface
guidelines. To the extent that you're able to educate yourself about common usability issues, you may be able to use that
expertise to partially compensate for some of paper prototyping's deficiencies. But don't expect &quot;armchair usability&quot; to
replace the real thing because there are many, many important problems that you'll never find if you look only for the
problems you know about.</mainDescription>
