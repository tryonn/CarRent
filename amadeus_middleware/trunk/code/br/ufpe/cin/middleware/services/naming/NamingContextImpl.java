/**
 * A name-to-object association is called a name binding.
 * A name binding is always defined relative to a naming context.
 * A naming context is an object that contains a set of name
 * bindings in which each name is unique. Different names can be
 * bound to an object in the same or different contexts at the
 * same time. There is no requirement, however, that all objects
 * must be named. To resolve a name is to determine the object
 * associated with the name in a given context. To bind a name is
 * to create a name binding in a given context. A name is always
 * resolved relative to a context - there are no absolute names.
 * Because a context is like any other object, it can also be bound
 * to a name in a naming context. Binding contexts in other contexts
 * creates a naming graph - a directed graph with nodes and labeled
 * edges where the nodes are contexts. A naming graph allows more
 * complex names to reference an object. Given a context in a naming
 * graph, a sequence of names can reference an object. This sequence
 * of names (called a compound name) defines a path in the naming graph
 * to navigate the resolution process.
 *
